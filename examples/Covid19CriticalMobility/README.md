# Critical mobility

The various jupyter notebooks in this directory contain code used to generate calculate _critical mobility_ as defined in the preprint [Critical Mobility, a practical criterion and early indicator for regional COVID-19 resurgence](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.20163790v1). In principle the various features used here to study the relation between COVID-19 incidence and mobility were generated with IBM PAIRS. However, for convenience we are also making them available at [this location](https://ibm.box.com/s/x5asx3u7qyaw8g182rfvo1vigz03lhg5).
