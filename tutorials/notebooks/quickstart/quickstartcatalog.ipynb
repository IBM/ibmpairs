When the weather model is run on a Monday it will generate a predictions for temperature on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. When the forecast is run on the Tuesday the predications are made for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday etc. The days for which predictions are generated are the data layer dimensions. \n",

Images are in 13 spectral bands at various ground resolutions: 4 bands at 10 m, 6 at 20 m and 3 at 60 m; the orbital swath is 290 km wide. Level 2A (L2A) images are 100x100 km ortho-rectified and spatially registered on a  global reference system; they are corrected for the atmosphere so they represent ground conditions. Currently PAIRS ingests Bands 4 (red), 8 (NIR) and SCL (Scene Classification). An NDVI layer, called \\\"NDVI sh\\\", is calculated from Bands 4 and 8. Tiles are ingested on request. Currently there is some coverage for tiles in USA, Brazil, India and the Netherlands for selected days in 2018 and 2019.
