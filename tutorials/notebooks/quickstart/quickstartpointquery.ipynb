Here, we are requesting a single raster layer with ID 49464. This is the *NDVI* layer in the *High res imagery (ESA Sentinel 2)* dataset. Next we define the spatial coverage of the query with the ``spatial`` key. In the above, we only request data for a single point in the format ``[latitude, longitude]``. Note that longitudes in PAIRS range from -180 to +180 degrees. Using values larger than +180 will lead to error messages. Similarly, latitudes range of course from -90 to +90 degrees.
