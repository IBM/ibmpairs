    "# Quick Start - Setting Up for the API\n",
    "## Our Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "All of the documentation and samples we provide are built using Jupyter notebooks. You can read the documentation in text form [here](https://pairs.res.ibm.com/tutorial/). You can run the notebooks yourself by cloning the [ibmpairs repository](https://github.com/IBM/ibmpairs) and looking at the \"notebooks\" directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the notebooks you will need a number of things:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Environmental Intelligence Suite API credentials stored in EIS_API_KEY, EIS_TENANT_ID (or EIS_CLIENT_ID) and EIS_ORG_ID environment variables\n",
    " * A Python3.7 or higher environment\n",
    " * A Jupyter Notebook environment\n",
    " * The ibmpairs pip package at version 3.0.0 or greater installed into you Python3 environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "Note that the notebooks include runnable examples but you need to run them in order from top to bottom. This is because there are some lines of set up code, for example, setting authentication credentials, that only appear in the first code cell. We leave them out subsequent cells to avoid clutter.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "Also note that in point 1 above you could change the notebooks so that you place your username and api key in-line in the code rather than using the environment variables included. However, we don't recommend this, as inclusion in a notebook increases the risk of your credentials being passed on to other people. \n",
    "</div> \n",
    "\n",
    "## Geospatial Analytics Credentials\n",
    "To access the user interface of the [Geospatial Analytics](https://ibmpairs.mybluemix.net) component of the [IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite](https://www.ibm.com/products/environmental-intelligence-suite?utm_medium=OSocial&utm_source=Linkedin&utm_content=DTPWW&utm_id=EIS-MM-ProductPage&social_post=5712196498&linkId=135589025) you will need a username and password. The username will typically be your IBMID but if you don't have credentials please contact your IBM representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Geospatial Analytics component also provides an API (at https://pairs.res.ibm.com). To use this you will also need an API key. If you don't have an API key please contact your IBM representative.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Jupyter Notebooks that are part of this quick start tutorial we don't include secret credentials. We read the credentials from operating system environment variables when they are required:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "EIS_API_KEY   = os.environ.get('EIS_API_KEY')\n",
    "EIS_TENANT_ID = os.environ.get('EIS_TENANT_ID')\n",
    "EIS_ORG_ID    = os.environ.get('EIS_ORG_ID')\n",
    "```\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "If you do not have a tenant id you can instead set a client id (e.g. EIS_CLIENT_ID) and pass client_id = EIS_CLIENT_ID to the authentication.OAuth2 object init or the get_client() call.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Set these values in your environment before you start so that they are ready to be used when required, for example, \n",
    "\n",
    "### On Linux\n",
    "In the shell where you will launch the Jupyter notebooks do the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "export EIS_API_KEY   = <your IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite api key key here>\n",
    "export EIS_TENANT_ID = <your IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite tenant key here>\n",
    "export EIS_ORG_ID    = <your IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite org id here>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, you can now start to use the notebooks provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On Windows\n",
    "Open the 'Environment Variables' dialog by doing the following\n",
    "\n",
    " * Type 'sysdm.cpl' into the 'Type here to search' box to bring up the 'System Properties' dialog\n",
    " * Select the 'Advanced' tab\n",
    " * Press the 'Environment Variables...' button\n",
    "\n",
    "On the 'Environment Variables' dialog you can create 'New...' environment variables for EIS_API_KEY, EIS_TENANT_ID and EIS_ORG_ID setting the values to the ones you have been given. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have set environment variables you need to start a new DOS prompt or Powershell. The new shells will adopt these new environment variables. From here, you can now start to use the notebooks provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Python3 \n",
    "\n",
    "The API tutorials are written in Python3. You can use any programming language by talking to the Geospatial Analytics HTTP endpoints using the standard HTTP libraries from your language of choice. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use Python3 but don't have an environment set up including Jupyter notebooks there are many resources on the internet that can help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PAIRS Python API Wrapper\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter notebooks in this tutorial use the [ibmpairs](https://github.com/IBM/ibmpairs) API wrapper for convenience. You will need to install this into your Python3 environment. Make sure you have install at least version 3.0.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a more detailed overview of the IBM PAIRS Python API Wrapper [here](tutorial/pythonapiwrapper.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "### PIP \n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install ibmpairs>=3.0.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing in Watson Studio Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "put the following code in a cell\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "!pip install ibmpairs\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Python3 Issues\n",
    "### Supported Python3 Versions\n",
    "The PAIRS Python API Wrapper is only tested on Python3 Version 3.7 and above. If you see error like the following when you are installing the wrapper then your Python3 version may be too old.\n",
    "```\n",
    "Collecting pandas>=1.0.1 (from ibmpairs==3.0.0)\n",
    "  Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement pandas>=1.0.1 (from ibmpairs==0.2.1) (from versions: 0.1, 0.2, 0.3.0, 0.4.0, 0.4.1, 0.4.2, 0.4.3, 0.5.0, 0.6.0, 0.6.1, 0.7.0, 0.7.1, 0.7.2, 0.7.3, 0.8.0, 0.8.1, 0.9.0, 0.9.1, 0.10.0, 0.10.1, 0.11.0, 0.12.0, 0.13.0, 0.13.1, 0.14.0, 0.14.1, 0.15.0, 0.15.1, 0.15.2, 0.16.0, 0.16.1, 0.16.2, 0.17.0, 0.17.1, 0.18.0, 0.18.1, 0.19.0, 0.19.1, 0.19.2, 0.20.0, 0.20.1, 0.20.2, 0.20.3, 0.21.0, 0.21.1, 0.22.0, 0.23.0, 0.23.1, 0.23.2, 0.23.3, 0.23.4, 0.24.0, 0.24.1, 0.24.2)\n",

    "### Missing Geospatial Libraries On Windows\n",
    "If you see the following error while builds are progressing as part of the PAIRS Python API Wrapper install:\n",
    "```\n",
    "A GDAL API version must be specified. Provide a path to gdal-config using a GDAL_CONFIG environment variable or use a GDAL_VERSION environment variable.\n",
    "```\n",
    "This indicates that your Windows environment is not configured properly in order to build the geospatial dependencies of the PAIRS Python API Wrapper. This can be tricky to get right. The easiest solution is to download and install the pre-build wheels for the following packages:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Fiona-1.8.18-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl\n",
    "GDAL-3.2.1-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl\n",
    "rasterio-1.2.0-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl\n",
    "Shapely-1.6.4.post2-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl\n",
    "basemap-1.2.2-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl\n",
    "```\n",
    "You may be able to take newer versions of these wheel packages but these are known to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many resources on the internet that give suggestion about how to obtain these packages, [for example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50876702/cant-install-fiona-on-windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a ``.whl`` file you can install it using pip by referencing it directly, for example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip3 install Fiona-1.8.18-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl\n",
