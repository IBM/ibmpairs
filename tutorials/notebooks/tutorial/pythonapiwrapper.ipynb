    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The ibmpairs Python API Wrapper (paw) is a python module that can be used to interact with the Geospatial Analytics component of the IBM Environmental Intelligence Suite (EIS). \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two versions of paw implemented across the various sub-modules that make up this library.\n",
    "\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "The `paw` will be deprecated at some point in the future, \n",
    "so if you are new to Geospatial Analytics use version 0.2.x sub-modules instead. \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Version 0.2.x is embodied in all of the other sub-modules. The query function of Version 0.1.x was improved and separated into a sub-module called `query` and various other modules were added to give more complete coverage of the Geospatial Analytics API. \n",

    "i.e. Each client side object, such as Query or Catalog, wraps the server side Query and Catalog APIs. Data objects on the client side allow the data and parameters of the API calls to be provided without having to worry about the technical implementation of the API, for example, URL encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally the client side objects are configured using data objects. Data objects can be expressed using JSON (or a Python dictionary), and inserted into the Geospatial Analytics objects with helper functions. e.g.:"
